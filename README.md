## Starfield simulation 
- [Toggle between manual and cosine wave for speed] 
- [Slider for speed]
## Boid entities 
- [Left mouse click to add boid] 
- [Right mouse click to add obstacle]
## Animated cardioid 
- [Factor changes with cosine wave] 
- [Slider for number of vertices on the circle with slider]
## Animated Marching squares on perlin noise field 
- [Toggle drawing noise field with black-to-white dots] 
- [Toggle interpolation of the shapes]
## Flow field simulation 
- [Toggle showing the vectors generated by perlin noise] 
- [Toggle drawing the traces of the particles (VERY LOW PERFORMANCE)]
- [Slider for speed of variation of vector field] 
- [Slider for max particle speed]
